## About this book

Welcome to the **Crab Monitoring Pipeline: Field Methods, Hardware, and Data Management**, an open-access guide developed by the Global Wetlands Project (GLOW) for standardized monitoring of crab biodiversity in mangrove ecosystems worldwide. This book provides comprehensive protocols for conducting camera-based surveys of crab populations using computer vision and AI-assisted analysis.

Crabs are keystone species in mangrove and coastal ecosystems. Through their bioturbation activities, they act as ecosystem engineers, altering sediment chemistry, influencing vegetation dynamics, and serving as critical food sources. Brachyuran crabs, in particular, are among the most dominant taxa in mangrove forests by both density and biomass. Despite their ecological importance, standardized methods for studying them at scale have been limited—until now.

### What you will find fere

This book is organized into three parts:

**Part 1: Motivation and Overview** introduces the Global Wetlands Project and explains why standardized, camera-based monitoring of crabs is essential for understanding mangrove ecosystem health across diverse geographic regions.

**Part 2: Experimental Design** details the hierarchical spatial structure (Points, Sites, Locations) and temporal considerations for surveys. It explains how to design robust studies that can answer both local and global ecological questions while accommodating varying resources and environmental conditions.

**Part 3: Field Methods** provides practical guidance on hardware specifications (cameras, monitoring rigs), required materials, deployment procedures, and camera settings. This section ensures teams worldwide can implement consistent, comparable field protocols.

### Who this is for

This guide is designed for:

- Research institutions studying coastal and mangrove ecosystems
- Community groups and NGOs conducting ecological monitoring
- Conservation practitioners working in wetland restoration
- Students and early-career researchers interested in field ecology methods

### Open Science Principles

All protocols, hardware specifications, and code are openly available. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/globalwetlands/crab-survey-methods) to access data collection templates, analysis scripts, and join our global community of practice.
